# Coding Task

### Overview

You have been tasked with creating a dashboard layout with a top bar, content and footer.

There will be x many links on the top bar. 

[ Home | Contacts | Search | Help ]

[ content ]

[ Footer ]

You must create a react app where each corresponding view renders in the content area. 

Home should render some statistical information about your contacts.

- How many you have
- Average Age
- How much they owe you :)
- Google Maps with locations of contacts

Contact section should render a view where you can see 10 at a time and should have pagination.

At last,

Search section should search the data and show the results.

Things to consider:

- resuse as much as possible
- avoid costly calculations
- document just enough.
